# Pitch Perfect
Pitch Perfect is an iPhone app that is just a bit of fun. It records a short message, then let's the user play back that message at different speeds and pitches. Some options are to make it sound like Darth Vader, or like a chipmunk. It was created as a project for the Udacity iOS Developer Nano-degree course.
